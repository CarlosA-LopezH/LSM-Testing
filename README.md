This project is intended as a checkup for different SNN libraries to ensure that they can produce a proper LSM.

# Python Libraries:
- Pytorch (Code from [1])
- Bindsnet
- SNNTorch (check name)
- PySNN (check name)
- Nengo

# Tests
Two tests will be performed to check the Separability (check name) property and the Approximation (check name) property.
This will be perfomed using the following link...
